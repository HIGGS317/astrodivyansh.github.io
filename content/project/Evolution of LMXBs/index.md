In this project, I have studied about millisecond pulsars, their formation history and evolution. I studied about binary systems of
Pulsars and small stars and how this system evolve. I studied these systems by permorfing simulations using stellar simulation code
<a href = "https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r24.03.1/" > MESA </a>. I studied how accretion from companion star influences the evolution of Neutron Star and Black Hole.
